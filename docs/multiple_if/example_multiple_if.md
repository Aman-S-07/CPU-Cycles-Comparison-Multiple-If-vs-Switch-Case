#### 1. *Choosing Activities Based on Weather.*
```python
tomorrow = "snowy"

if tomorrow == "warm":
    print("I'll go to the sea.")
elif tomorrow == "very hot":
    print("I'll go to the forest.")
elif tomorrow == "snowy":
    print("I'll build a snowman.")
elif tomorrow == "rainy":
    print("I'll stay home.")
else:
    print("Weather not recognized.") 
```
#### Description: 
- This code snippet is a simple way to decide what to do based on the weather forecast for tomorrow.
#### How It Works:
- Tomorrow's Weather: The weather for tomorrow is set to "snowy".
- Decision Making: The code checks the weather and prints out an activity based on the condition:
- If it’s "warm", it suggests going to the sea.
- If it’s "very hot", it suggests going to the forest.
- If it’s "snowy" (which it is in this case), it suggests building a snowman.
- If it’s "rainy", it suggests staying home.
- If the weather doesn’t match any of these options, it prints "Weather not recognized."
#### Result: With the current setup ("snowy"), the code will suggest building a snowman.
