#### Use Switch-Case when:
- You are checking a single variable against multiple possible values.
- Performance is important, and you want to minimize CPU cycles.

#### Example Scenario:
- Let’s consider a scenario where you’re writing a program to decide an action based on the day of the week. 
- Each day has a specific activity assigned. In this case, using Switch-Case is ideal because you are checking one variable (day_of_week) against multiple possible values ("Monday", "Tuesday", etc.).

##### Python Code Example Using Dictionary (as Python does not have native Switch-Case)
- Since Python doesn't have a built-in Switch-Case syntax, we can simulate it using a dictionary to map keys (possible values of the variable) to corresponding actions:
```python
def activity_for_day(day_of_week):
    switch_case = {
        "Monday": "Go to the gym.",
        "Tuesday": "Attend a meeting.",
        "Wednesday": "Work from home.",
        "Thursday": "Go grocery shopping.",
        "Friday": "Go out with friends.",
        "Saturday": "Relax and watch TV.",
        "Sunday": "Spend time with family."
    }
    
    return switch_case.get(day_of_week, "Invalid day of the week.")

day_of_week = "Friday"
print(activity_for_day(day_of_week))
```
#### Why Use Switch-Case Here?
##### `Single variable check`: 
- We are only checking one variable (day_of_week) and comparing it against several known values ("Monday", "Tuesday", etc.).
#####  `Performance`: 
- In scenarios where there are many conditions (like checking all 7 days), using a Switch-Case reduces the number of comparisons. 
- The program evaluates the variable (day_of_week) once and quickly jumps to the correct result based on its value. This improves performance and reduces CPU cycles.

##### `Summary`:
- Switch-Case is ideal when you are checking one variable against multiple possible values. 
- It is faster and more efficient compared to Multiple-If because it avoids evaluating each condition separately. 
- If performance is critical (such as in larger programs or systems that handle many conditions), Switch-Case helps minimize CPU cycles and improves execution speed.
