- In some languages like C or Java, `Switch-Case` allows for direct comparison of values, which avoids the need for multiple condition checks. 
- Python does not have a native `switch-case`, but it can be mimicked using a `dictionary`.

#### Why does Python not have a "switch" statement?
##### Most languages need switch/case due to limited mapping constructs: 
- Many languages lack a built-in, flexible mapping construct like Python's dictionaries. As a result, they rely on switch/case statements to associate values with specific actions.
- Mapping values to functions is a limitation: In these languages, you can't directly map a value to a function, which makes switch/case statements necessary.
#### Python's dictionaries provide a powerful mapping construct: 
- Python's dictionaries (or mapping tables) allow you to easily associate values with functions, making switch/case statements redundant.
- Python's flexibility eliminates the need for switch/case: With dictionaries, you can create a mapping table where a certain value maps to a specific function, making it unnecessary to have a separate switch/case statement.
