- In this document, we will explore two common programming techniques used for decision-making:   
* `Multiple-If` Statements and `Switch-Case`. 
- We will also discuss how these affect `CPU cycles` and when to use each one. 
- By the end, youâ€™ll have a better understanding of how to make decisions in Python code and how efficient each method is in terms of `processing power`.
